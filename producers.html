			<!-- <p class="cardHeader">Andy Clark</p> -->
			<p class="bodyText">
				<span class="gradientText">Andrew Clark</span>, who goes by the producer name “Blinders,” is an EDM producer, composer, and jazz pianist from Roseville, CA. As an avid music listener, he draws inspiration from many different artists and styles to arrive at his varied sound. The name Blinders itself is a reference to this philosophy of drawing on many different genres for inspiration. When starting out as a producer, Andrew didn’t want his music to fit narrowly into one genre, so for this project, he decided to remove his musical “blinders” and pursue a broader vision that’s based around personal experimentation and inspiration from his favorite artists. While his music spans several different genres, his primary influences include Jacob Collier, Thundercat, San Holo, Duskus, Anomolie, and others. When producing music, his primary goal is to create music that is worth every second that listeners spend listening to it. I hope you enjoy!
